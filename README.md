# Prerequisite resources for the sidecar tutorial

In this repository is a ready-run Azure Developer CLI template, which generates the Azure resources you need to follow along with [Tutorial: Configure a sidecar container for custom container in Azure App Service (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/tutorial-custom-container-sidecar).

## Quickstart

See [Tutorial: Configure a sidecar container for custom container in Azure App Service (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/tutorial-custom-container-sidecar).

The template is meant to be run in the Azure Cloud Shell. To run it elsewhere, you need to first sign into both the Azure CLI (`az login`) and the Azure Developer CLI (`azd auth login`).
